## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise class open source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS). Its is a relational database that supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.

PostgreSQL possesses robust feature sets including Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, granular access controls, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions, online/hot backups, a refined query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging. It supports international character sets, multi-byte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. PostgreSQL is highly scalable both in the quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.

The course provides the learner with an extensive knowledge of PostgreSQL Database Administration with real time examples.
